HTML
    Intro - 
Overview of the web in general, browsers, servers, devices and how they connect. Apparently this book was written as HTML5 and CSS3 were still being written. Also, a nice graph of the what happens when you connect to a DNS server.
    CH 1 - 
Mostly covering structure and page layout, starting with word documents and getting more detailed layouts. I like isolating the head, title and body, that helps me clarify what constitutes as what.
    CH 8 -
Going more in depth about tags, things like adding comments in your code and identifying class and ids. I'm still a little confused about how spans work but i think the div section is pretty clear. I would love to know more about what <meta> can do!
    CH 17
This is seems very useful as it expands on chapter 1's layout ideas. Dissecting the <body> of the page is very important as it was a little unclear to me what how the <header> and <footer> factor in. I guess maybe I was unclear of the definition of the two. <Nav> is used to contain major navigational blocks on the site. The <section> groups related content together. All this is to provide clearer code other than using many <div> elements.
    CH 18
Understanding our target audience may be one of the biggest takeaways from this book yet. Having a clear goal in mind and following your site map seems really important. The importance of communication and visual heirarchy helps visitors understand what they are looking at. Keeping it simple and using wireframes also helps.

JAVASCRIPT
    INTRO
It seems like JS's ability to make webpages interactive is it's biggest strength. There's a few examples here as well as a layout for the rest of the book. 
    CH 1
This section is on the most macro view of programming, it talks about scripts and how they can be complicated or simple but its good to have your goal in mond before you start. Then we walk through the steps of designing a script, tasks, steps and then to the code. This also talk about computers using data, objects and properties as part of their core language. Then it goes on the next section which talks about how to write script for webpages and interacting with the HTML element. This barely touches on identifying errors and how the HTML will not be changed because the Javascript works with the browser.
